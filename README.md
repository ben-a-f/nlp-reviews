# Amazon Digital Music Reviews
We use ~1.5 million Amazon digital music reviews to:
1. Trial several models that aim to predict the score (1-5*) from the review text.
2. Explore the text to look for useful business insights.

Dataset: Amazon Reviews - Digital Music
Source: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/
The dataset is not included in this Git repository at present, as even when compressed it is too large. You will have to download it yourself from the link above if you want to rerun any of this analysis.
I am looking into Git LFS to get around this restriction and will hopefully resolve this shortly.
